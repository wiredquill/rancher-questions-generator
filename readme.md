This plan outlines the architecture, features, and technology stack for an application that provides a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface for generating questions.yaml files for Helm charts.

1. High-Level Architecture
The application will be a containerized, single-page application (SPA) with a backend API, designed for deployment on Kubernetes.

Frontend: A responsive web interface built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React or Vue). This is the client-side component that users interact with.

Backend API: A server-side application (e.g., built with Go, Python, or Node.js) that handles the core logic. It will fetch, unpack, and parse Helm charts, manage the state of the form configuration, and serve it to the frontend.

Kubernetes Deployment:

Frontend: Served as static assets from a lightweight web server like Nginx, running in its own pod.

Backend: Deployed as a separate service and pod, handling API requests from the frontend.

Ingress: An Ingress controller will manage external access to the frontend and route API requests to the backend service.

2. Core Functionality & User Workflow
The primary goal is to provide a "virtual install" experience where a user can dynamically build and preview a Rancher-style installation form.

Input: The user provides a URL to a Helm chart .tgz file.

Processing:

The backend downloads the specified Helm chart archive.

It unpacks the .tgz file in a temporary, isolated directory.

It parses the values.yaml to identify all configurable parameters.

It looks for an existing questions.yaml. If one exists, it's parsed; if not, a default structure is created.

Form Emulation:

The backend serves the parsed values.yaml data and the questions.yaml structure to the frontend.

The frontend dynamically renders an interactive form based on this data.

Drag-and-Drop Interface:

A two-panel UI will be presented.

Panel 1 (Values Explorer): Displays a tree-view of all keys from the values.yaml. Users can browse all available options.

Panel 2 (Form Builder): Represents the questions.yaml. Users can drag keys from the Values Explorer into this panel to "expose" them as questions for the end-user.

Default Questions: The Form Builder will be pre-populated with a set of default, essential questions:

Application Name: variable: name

Namespace: variable: namespace

Storage Class: variable: persistence.storageClass (with logic to detect if persistence is used)

Service Type: variable: service.type (presented as a dropdown with options like ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)

Configuration & Tweaking:

Once a value is dragged into the Form Builder, the user can configure its properties as defined by the questions.yaml spec.

Helper Text: An input field to add description text for each question.

Labels & Grouping: Ability to set the label and group for organization.

Type Casting: Define the input type (e.g., string, int, boolean, enum).

Live Preview & Output:

As the user makes changes in the Form Builder, the changes are reflected in real-time.

A "Get questions.yaml" button will allow the user to copy or download the generated YAML file.

3. Backend API Endpoints
A RESTful API will facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.

Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/chart	Accepts a JSON payload like { "url": "..." }. Downloads and processes the chart. Returns a session ID.
GET	/api/chart/{session_id}	Retrieves the parsed values.yaml and questions.yaml for the given session.
PUT	/api/chart/{session_id}	Updates the questions.yaml structure for the session based on user changes in the UI.
GET	/api/chart/{session_id}/q	Returns the raw, generated questions.yaml file for the current state.

4. Technology Stack Suggestion
This stack is chosen for its robustness, performance, and compatibility with a cloud-native environment.

Frontend:

Framework: React with TypeScript for type safety.

UI Components: Material-UI (MUI) or Ant Design for pre-built components.

Drag & Drop: react-dnd or dnd-kit.

State Management: Zustand or Redux Toolkit.

Backend:

Language: Go is an excellent choice due to its performance, static typing, and strong support for concurrency, which is ideal for handling downloads and file processing. The standard library is well-suited for creating an HTTP server.

Libraries:

helm.sh/helm/v3/pkg/chart/loader for loading Helm charts.

gopkg.in/yaml.v3 for parsing YAML files.

Deployment:

Containerization: Docker.

Orchestration: Kubernetes.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to build and push container images and deploy to the cluster.
